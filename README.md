# Freesurfer
Learning notes on how to use freesurfer to analyze structural data
## 1. Organize the data into one folder
- See example ***T1\_organize.sh***
## 2. Execute preprocessing shell script
  
   ### 2.1 recon-all with parallel processing
   - Use the ***FS_preprocess.sh*** 
   - View the results with **freeview**
   ### 2.2 orgnaize the output data for the next step.
   - Create three folders, FS, FSGD, Contrasts
   - Put all output data into FS
   - Creat [FSGD file](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsgdExamples) (.fsgd) under FSGD
   - Creat [Contrast file](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsgdExamples) (.mtx) under Contrasts


## 3. Execute postprocessing shell script

   ### 3.1 Concatenating all subfiles into one big file 
   with ***mris_preproc***
  
   ### 3.2 Fitting the general linear model 
   with ***mri_glmfit***
  
   ### 3.3 Cluster correction 
   with ***mri_glmfit-sim***
   
## 4. Folders meaning

? was often used to represent left or right
### label:
It includes labels of several brain atlas, such as 
```
  ?h.apar.DKTatlas.annot  >>> Desikan-Killiany atlas

  ?h.aparc.a2009s.annot >>> Destrieax atlas
```
### MRI:
compasses all the volume data
```
  raw_avg.mgz >>> the raw volume data in raw space resolution

  others >>> in the normalized space
```
### scripts:
it contains the scripts or logs when it goes through processing
```
  recon-all.log  >>> the log file you can go through if there is something wrong
```
### stats:
contains the statistics of the brain, such as the thickness or volume of different brain regions.

### surf:
includes all the surface files
```
  ?h.orig & ?h.white >>> the boundary between the white matter and the grey matter

  ?h.pial >>> the boundary between the grey matter and the pia matter

  ?h.inflated >>> inflated brain 

  ?h.thickness or ?h.volume >>> values of the thickness or volume projected onto the inflated brain
```
## 5. Projection between volume space and surface space
Volume space: native volume and [MNI space](https://www.lead-dbs.org/about-the-mni-spaces/);
```
  MNI space (MNI152NLin2009cAsym-fMRIprep; MNI152NLin6Asym-FSL);
```
Surface space: native surface (generated from freesurfer) and standard surfaces ([fsaverage](https://brainder.org/2016/05/31/downsampling-decimating-a-brain-surface/); fsLR file formate [CIFTI](https://balsa.wustl.edu/about/fileTypes))
```
  fsaverage (fs3>>1k; fs4>>3k; fs5>>10k; fs6>>41k; fs7>>164k); per hemisphere
  fsLR (fsLR32k; fsLR164k) per hemisphere 
```
### 5.1 Projection native volume >> native/fsaverage surface, or fsLR surface

[from native > native surface> fsaverage > fsLR](https://github.com/MengYunWang/Freesurfer/blob/main/Resampling-FreeSurfer-HCP_5_8.pdf) (This is the recommended procedure to project to fsLR space) 

***?.sphere.reg is the registration file from native surface to fsaverage***

[How to project from native to fsaverage and to fsLR](https://osf.io/k89fh/wiki/Surface/)

[toolbox](https://github.com/DiedrichsenLab/surfAnalysis/tree/master) based on matlab

### 5.2 Projection MNI volume >> fsaverage surface

#### 5.2.1 freesurf ([Affine and MNIsurf](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion/freesurfer_baseline/utilities))
```
mri_vol2surf >> from volume data to surface data
mri_surf2vol >> from surface data to volume data
mri_surf2surf >> from surface to surface, standardize or downsample or upsample (i.e. native to fs; fs to fs5)
```
#### 5.2.2 [Registration fusion](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion) (RF-M3Z and RF-ANTs)

**The two methods mentioned above can only convert the data from the MNI to fsaverage, and within fsaverage, but can not project into fsLR format.**
